- [theory and internals](theory_and_internals.md)
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection, specifying specific files, exploring a repository (e.g. git diff, git log)
- why nice commits: blame, bisect (git add -p)
- commit history handling: ammend, rebase, restore, reset
- types of merges
- merge conflict resolving
- branching strategies
- gitlab goodies
