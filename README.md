# Git workshop material

This repo will be a workshop outline and some practice problems with git.

See [my collection of materials](https://bence.ferdinandy.com/materials/git/)
and my [post on commits](https://bence.ferdinandy.com/gitcraft).

## Topics

- why in CLI: universal, full api
- [theory and internals](theory_and_internals.md)
- [repository exploration](exploration.md)
- why nice commits: blame, bisect (git add -p)
- commit history handling: ammend, rebase, restore, reset
- types of merges
- merge conflict resolving
- branching strategies
- gitlab goodies
